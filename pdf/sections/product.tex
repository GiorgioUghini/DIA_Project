		In this project we would like to focus our attention on a specific product: a luxury scarf. We decided to take into consideration this item because it's a seasonal product that is more searched by its buyers in the cold seasons and less demanded during the summer days. This periodic variation of the users' interests is an interesting input to take in consideration during our analysis. We decided to use as a subject the classical Louis Vuitton brand logo scarf, well known and trending in our country.
