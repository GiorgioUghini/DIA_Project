		In this project we focus our attention on a mid-luxury scarf that is sold in a price range starting from \texteuro200 to \texteuro400, to give an idea. This item is a seasonal product and it is more searched by its buyers in the cold seasons rather than in summer, when it has less demand. This periodic variation of the users' interest is a remarkable input to take into account during our analysis. We decided to use as a subject the classical Louis Vuitton brand logo scarf, well known and trending in our country.
