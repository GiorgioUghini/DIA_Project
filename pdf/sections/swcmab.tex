The pseudo code of the algoritm we implemented is as follow.
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Gaussian Process CMAB}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\renewcommand{\algorithmicrequire}{\textbf{Input:}}
		\REQUIRE $\tau$ sliding window size, $J$ classes of users
		\FOR{$j \in \{1,...,J\}$}
		\STATE Sample GP-Learner($\tau$)
		\STATE Add row to knapsack matrix
		\ENDFOR
		\STATE Optimize knapsack matrix
		\STATE Play selected arm
		\STATE Update GP-Learner model($\tau$)
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\\The update of the GP-Learner's model performed at time $\tau$ is achieved by adding the collected reward to the reward space and then discarding the least element if the current time exceeds $\tau$.
