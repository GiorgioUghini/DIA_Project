In the next few slides, we will focus on a context generation algorithm for the pricing when the budget allocated to each single sub-campaign is fixed. This means that we focus on trying to understand the different behaviors that the three class of users studied may follow. Since the three types of users are different by means of purchasing power, price discrimination may be important to further increase the reward instead of considering the users as a single class. Therefore, our goal is to understand whether or not it can be useful to divide the users in the various classes or not.
We suppose to receive in our website 2000 clicks per day and since is required to perform the test every week, the split condition is checked every 14000 clicks.
