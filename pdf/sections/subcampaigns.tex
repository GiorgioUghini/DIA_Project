In order to advertise our product we outlined three different sub-campaigns, each with a unique aspect and a particular type of user as a target. The three sub-campaigns are focused on:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The Quality Of The Product}:\@ \newline Targeting the women with children living in the north of Italy.
	\item \textbf{The Social Impact Generated By The Product}:\@ \newline Targeting the women without children living in the north of Italy.
	\item \textbf{The Peculiarity And The Uniqueness Of The Product}:\@ \newline Targeting the women with children living in the south of Italy.
\end{itemize}
