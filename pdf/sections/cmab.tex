The pseudo code of the algoritm we implemented is as follow.
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Gaussian Process CMAB}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\FOR{$j \in \{1,...,J\}$}
		\STATE Sample GP-Learner
		\STATE Add row to knapsack matrix
		\ENDFOR
		\STATE Optimize knapsack matrix
		\STATE Play selected arm
		\STATE Update GP-Learner model
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
